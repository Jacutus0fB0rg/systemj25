This is a test of my final project, the SystemJ25 website

Final Project Technical Specification

My Final Project will be a Website for SystemJ25 Enterprises, a business I hope to start.
The SystemJ25 Website will showcase the products and services I can provide to customers.

There will be webpages for each type of product or service and the webpages will describe the product or service and show examples for the customer to experience.
The examples will be images of the products themselves or videos of the product being demonstrated.

The website will have a Star Trek: The Next Generation theme to it where the webpages will look as much like the computer display panels from  Star Trek: The Next Generation as possible.

The website will have a means for customers to request a product or service and for me to answer that request.

The website will also have a webpage which will be like a community bulletin board where the visitors can read messages from me and other visitors and leave their own messages.  The webpage will be written to encourage the visitor to leave a message about his or her thoughts, opinions, theorys, beliefs or statements about Star Trek.

## Home page
Needless to say all the pages will have links to the other pages.  The home page will just have a greeting welcoming the user to the website, an encouragement to go to the other linked pages, the story behind the website and a little Borg ship animation that happens when clicked on by the user.

## 3D Printing page
The 3D Printing page will just have a carousel of pictures of the model of the Class I Destroyer I modeled and 3D printed.

## 3D Animation page
The 3D Animation page will just have the two videos I animated and the stories behind the two videos.

## Augmented Reality Business Card page
The Augmented Reality Business Card page will have a demonstration video of an Augmented Reality Business Card and a carousel of pictures of the AR Business Cards I have made for current customers. 

## Contact page
The Contact page will just have a set of instructions on what information to send me for a product/service request and a mailto link that will launch their email handler with a sample email to me requesting a product and/or service.

## Message Board
Lastly, the Message Board page will be created according to the following specification:

 Message Board Tech Spec
A message will consist of the message text, the author's name and the time/date that the message was posted.

The message board will enable users to post messages which will be displayed by the message board app  to the message board webpage.

The webpage will have controls for composing messages as well as controls to select how the messages are displayed.  By default, the messages will be displayed in the order they were posted (last message posted will be at the bottom of the list).  There will be a control to select the sort order of the messages (either chronological or reverse chronological order).

The app will make a list of authors of posted messages and display it.  The app will also enable the user to view all the messages from a particular author in ascending or descending time/date order.  When viewing a particular author's messages, all other authors will be removed from the author's list and all messages from other authors will be removed from the message list. There will be a button to return to viewing all messages from all authors.  This will hopefully enable users to more easily respond to each other's messages.

### Message Creation Panel interface
The message creation panel will have a text area within which the user can enter the message text, a text input field to enter their full name and another text field that shows the current time/date.  There will be a "Post Message" button.
Also, messages with blank message text and/or author name will not be posted.  The user will be given an "Invalid message..." and/or an "Invalid name..." message if they try to post a message with blank message text and/or blank name.

The message creation panel will have an "Enlarge" button that brings up a modal on which the user can create a message (hopefully to give the user more message space).  A message can be started on the message creation panel and finished on the modal.  The user can even go back and forth between the panel and the modal until the user finishes creating his or her message and posting it.  

### Posted Message Interface
Each message on the list will also have a button marked "Enlarge" which will bring up a modal which will enable the user to view the message in a larger view (this is for messages that have a large amount of message text).  The message text in the modal will be scrollable.
